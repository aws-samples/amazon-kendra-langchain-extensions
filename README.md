# AWS Kendra Langchain Extensions

## kendra_retriever_samples
This directory contains samples for a QA chain using an `AmazonKendraRetriever` class. For more info see the samples [README](./kendra_retriever_samples/README.md).
**Note**: If you are using an older version of the repo which contains the `aws_langchain` package, please clone this repo in a new location to avoid any conflicts with the older environment. We are deprecating the `aws_langchain` package, since the kendra retriever class is available in LangChain starting v0.0.213.

For detials of the implementation please refer to blog  : https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/quickly-build-high-accuracy-generative-ai-applications-on-enterprise-data-using-amazon-kendra-langchain-and-large-language-models/
